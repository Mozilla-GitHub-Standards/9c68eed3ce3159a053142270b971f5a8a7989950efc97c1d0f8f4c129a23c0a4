MozTrap Python dependencies
===========================

Python dependencies of the MozTrap test case management system.
Pulled in as a submodule of https://github.com/mozilla/moztrap/

Packages can be added here with ``pip install --download=.
packageName==version``.

This repo can be used as the package source for an installation by pointing
pip's ``--find-links`` option at this directory (and optionally using
``--no-index`` to avoid network checks as well).
